# tailmatter

This library does what you might expect: it's a frontmatter parser where the Yaml
component is at the end of the file instad of the beginning. It's pretty esoteric but an
important part of something I'm building where I want the ability to add metadata to
Markdown documents but I want to keep the content of the document front and center.
